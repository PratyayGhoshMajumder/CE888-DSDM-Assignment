# CE888-DSDM-Assignment
Dataset of this project has been downloaded from https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success. This is based on acedemic education and we have to predict whether the students has graduate of dropout
CODE:
The code is present in github repository: https://github.com/PratyayGhoshMajumder/CE888-DSDM-Assignment
SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTATION THAT IS DONE"
Data preprocessing
Exploraory data analysis
Since it is imbalance dataset oversampling is done
At first used baseline random forest method and we have used stratified sampling and after that used hyperparameter tuning with different values and parameter
Model buliding using machine learning techniques: Random forest method, KNN and logistics regression
Classifier results is compared and find out which one is the best model
INSTRUCTION TO RUN THE CODE:
Go to github link https://github.com/PratyayGhoshMajumder/CE888-DSDM-Assignment
Run in jupyter notebook
